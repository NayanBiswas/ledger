# todo

Example Ledger application.

The application keeps a list of todo items in a Ledger page, randomly adds and
removes items, and prints the state after each modification.

The application takes a tag as an optional positional argument, so that items
being added by the application on different devices can be distinguished.


To run the application:

```
@ bootstrap todo
```

or, to run with a tag:

```
@ bootstrap todo Device1
```
