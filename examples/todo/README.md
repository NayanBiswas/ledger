# todo

Example Ledger application.

The application keeps a list of todo items in a Ledger page, randomly adds and
removes items, and prints the state after each modification. To run the application:

```
@ bootstrap todo
```

Items generated by each instance are tagged with a unique tag, so, to observe
the application running on multiple devices and synchronizing the state using
Ledger, set up Cloud Sync on each device and run the app twice.

Example output:

```
[00053.199] 02933.02949> --- To Do ---
[00053.199] 02933.02949> [ 18355 ] write a spec for the law of gravity

[00053.200] 02933.02949> [ 24673 ] find the society
